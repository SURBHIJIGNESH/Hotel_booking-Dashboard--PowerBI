# Hotel_booking-Dashboard--PowerBI

This project is supervised learning based on the data provided. The steps that are taken into consideration when developing a model for supervised learning are listed below.

1.	Collect the data according to the task
2.	Prepare data: cleaning data with Excel and Power Query is part of this procedure. Below is a description of the cleaning process:
-	Deleting or replacing missing values in each variable
-	Removing duplicate data
-	Changing variable data types
-	Add calculated or conditional column when it's required

Then, using the data analysis function in Excel, analyse or visualize your data by constructing co-relations between each variable, plotting histograms or distributions of variables, and calculating descriptive statics. 

3.	Predictive Problems: Identifying business questions that a trained model can answer using previous data and predict future results. 
4.	Select an algorithm based on collected data and tasks. Supervised learning uses two algorithms: classification and regression. In this project, the supervised learning model is chosen depending on the dataset's category, such as use classification if the goal variable is categorical; otherwise, regression requires numerical continuous values. Furthermore, classification has two types: binary and multi classification and it is based on categorical values.
5.	Fit or train a model utilizing a variety of tools, such as Microsoft Azure studio, by loading cleaned datasets, select appropriate columns where regression algorithm required dependent variable and splitting them into Train (70%) and Test (30%) datasets, with the test dataset being used to evaluate the trained model. Train your model using the supervised learning algorithm and the training dataset. In Microsoft Azure Studio, link the train model to the split train dataset and choose a method such as decision tree for classification and logical regression for regression.
6.	Measure the performance of a trained supervised model using a test dataset, using confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, and precision for classification models and R-Square and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for regression models. This procedure is likewise carried out on Microsoft Azure Studio.
7.	Output: Finally, after the model has been trained, visualize the results by building dashboards in PowerBI tools and pivot tables and charts in Excel, as this is the best approach to communicate the findings by analysing it, knowing the pattern of data, and solving business problems.
